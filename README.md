## What is ez50?

ez50 is a community-built tool that makes working with CS50 problem sets **EASY** (or ez). Instead of copying and pasting commands from Harvard's website, finding the right files, and extracting them manually, you just type one command and you're ready to code!

**It's like an automation for the boring stuff!**

## Commands

### 📥 Download a Problem Set

```bash
ez50 world
```

This downloads the problem set, sets up your folder, and gets everything ready to go!

### ✅ Check Your Solution

```bash
ez50 check world
# short version:
ez50 c world
```

Runs the official `check50` tool to test your code.

### 📤 Submit Your Solution

```bash
ez50 submit world
# short version:
ez50 s world
```

Submits your problem set using the official `submit50` tool.

## Nice Features:

### But I'm in a different year!

All commands support the `--year` or `-y` option:

```bash
ez50 world --year 2024
ez50 check world -y 2025
```

### What if I don't trust you!

Use `--dry-run` or `-dr` to see what commands will execute **without actually running** them:

```bash
ez50 world --dry-run
╭─ Info ─────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Dry Run: The following commands WOULD be executed: │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
╭─ Info ───────────╮
│   > mkdir world  │
│   > cd world     │
│   > code hello.c │
│   > ls           │
╰──────────────────╯
```

### Problem Sets

**ez50** supports all\* CS50 problem sets! This includes: **CS50x**, **CS50P**, **CS50WEB**, **CS50SQL**, **CS50AI**, **CS50R**

## About

This is an **unofficial, community-built tool**. It is **NOT** affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Harvard University or the CS50 course. It's made by Students for Students to save time on repetitive tasks.

The official CS50 tools (check50, submit50) are still used under the hood, ez50 just makes them easier to use.
